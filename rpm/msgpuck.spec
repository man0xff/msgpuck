Summary: MsgPack serialization library in a self-contained header file
Provides: msgpuck-static = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: msgpuck%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description
MsgPack is a binary-based efficient object serialization library.
It enables to exchange structured objects between many languages like JSON.
But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.

msgpuck is very lightweight header-only library designed to be inlined to
your application by the C/C++ compiler. The library is fully documented and
covered by unit tests.

msgpuck is very lightweight header-only library designed to be inlined to
your application by the C/C++ compiler. The library is fully documented and
covered by unit tests.

This package provides a self-contained header file and a static library.
The static library contains generated code for inlined functions and
globals tables needed by the some library functions.
